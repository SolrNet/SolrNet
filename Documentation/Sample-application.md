# Sample application

A [sample web application](https://github.com/solrnet/SolrNetSampleApps) is provided to demo some of the library's features. This sample application is not meant to be an absolute reference of SolrNet integration with your application. Real world applications are likely to need much more complex interactions with SolrNet.
